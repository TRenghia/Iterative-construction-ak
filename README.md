## A Mathematica implementation of Savoâ€™s algorithm for the computation of the heat content asymptotics

Find attached the Mathematica notebook "Algorithm ak final". 

In the script, we will set a non commutative algebra of operators. To properly deal with non commutative formal operators, we will need the NCAlgebra package (for download and further information, see the Link http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ncalg/, Copyright (c) Helton and de Oliveira 2017,  All rights reserved).
